<!-- PROJECT STRUCTURE -->

### Project Structure

#### Root Directories
- `docs`: Contains files related to the documentation of the project.
- `res`: Contains all the static resources used by the app, which are the app icon (located in the `img` folder) and the i18n files (located in the `locales` folder).
- `src`: Contains the source code files of the app.

#### Root Files

- `.gitignore`: File used by the version control system Git to specify files or directories that should be ignored by Git when tracking changes to a project.
- `audiotext.spec`: Used to generate an executable file with [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/). Notice that, inside the file, there is the annotation `PATH TO CUSTOMTKINTER`. You will have to replace it by the actual path in your computer. To get it, you can execute `pip show customtkinter`.  
- `LICENSE`: Project license, which is [Creative Commons 1.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).
- `README.md`: What you are reading right now.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the names and versions of each package used to build this project. To install the requirements, execute `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
 
<!-- BUILT WITH -->

### Built With

- [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter)
- [moviepy](https://pypi.org/project/moviepy/)
- [PyAudio](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/)
- [pydub](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub)
- [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

### Important 
You need to install [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) to execute the program. Otherwise, it won't be able to process the audio files. You can download FFmpeg from the [official site](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

### To Execute the Program
- Go to [releases](https://github.com/HenestrosaConH/audiotext/releases)
- Download the latest release. 
- Uncompress the downloaded file
- Open the `audiotext` folder 
- Depending on the OS:
  - **Windows**: Open the `audiotext.exe` file
  - **GNU-Linux and macOS**: Open the `audiotext` file. 

### To Open the Code
- Clone the project with the `git clone https://github.com/HenestrosaConH/audiotext.git` command and then open it in your favourite IDE (mine is [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)).
- Please bear in mind that you cannot generate a single executable file for this project with PyInstaller due to the dependency with the CustomTkinter package (reason [here](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter/wiki/Packaging)).
- It is crucial to note that I have had to comment out the line `pprint(response_text, indent=4)` in the `recognize_google` function from the `__init__.py` file of the `SpeechRecognition` package. If it was not commented, the project would need to run a command line along with the GUI. Otherwise, the program would not run when calling this function because the mentioned line throws an error that stops the function from running (in case that the program does not run on a console), which cannot be handled within the project code.
- Similar to the point above, the lines 159, 160 and 176 of the file `ffmpeg_audiowriter` from the `moviepy` package are commented for the same reason stated above. There is also a change in the line 169. `logger=logger` has been changed to `logger=None` to avoid more errors related to opening the console.
- For Mac M1 users: There is a problem installing the `pyaudio` library. [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73268630/error-could-not-build-wheels-for-pyaudio-which-is-required-to-install-pyprojec) is a StackOverflow post explaining how to solve this issue.

<!-- USAGE -->

## Usage

Once you open the Audiotext executable file (explained in the [getting started](#getting-started) section), you will see something like this:

![main-system][main-system]

### Select Audio File

Click on the `Select audio file` button and select a file from the file explorer. Please note that audio files are selected by default. To select video files, you will have to click on the combo box in the bottom right corner of the file explorer to change the file type, as indicated in red in the following image:

![file-explorer][file-explorer]

Once you select the file, a green button named `Generate transcription` will show up. Click on it to start generating the transcription.

If there is no error, you will see the audio's transcription in the text box, as shown in the [About the Project's gif](#about-the-project).

Please bear in mind that this process may take some time to complete, depending on the length of the file and whether it is an audio or video file.

### Transcribe From Microphone

You just have to click on the `Transcribe from microphone` button and say whatever you want to be transcribed.
Please keep in mind that your Operating System needs to recognize an input source. Otherwise, an error will be shown in the text box indicating that no microphone was detected.

It is also worth noting that you have 3 seconds to speak from the moment you click the button to the timeout. In case that no input was received, you will see an error in the text box notifying it. I might add a setting in the program to change it to let the user change it. 

### Save Transcription

Once the program has generated the transcription, you will see a green button named `Save transcription` below the text box.

![generated-transcription][generated-transcription]

To save it, you just have to click on the mentioned button. A file explorer will be prompted. You have to give the file a name and select the path where you want to store it. By default, the extension of the file is `.txt`, but you can change it to any other file type you want.

### Appearance Mode

The program supports three appearance modes:

<details>
  <summary>System</summary>

  <summary>Dark</summary>
  <img src="docs/main-system.png" alt="Dark theme">
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Light</summary>
  <img src="docs/main-light.png" alt="Light theme">
</details>

### API Usage

Since the program makes use of Google's Speech-To-Text API free tier, which can transcribe up to 60 minutes of audio per month at no cost,
you might have to add an API key if you want to make extensive use of this functionality.

However, there is no option in the GUI to add it, so you have to add it manually. This can be done by adding the `key=<ACTUAL API KEY>` argument to both `recognize_google()` methods in the file `src/controller/main_controller.py`.

Notwithstanding, I have the intention to move from **speech_recognition** package to [whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper). This change would allow the user to generate audio transcriptions unlimitedly and offline, which is a major step forward for the program.

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

- [ ] Move from **speech_recognition** package to [whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper).
- [ ] Add pre-commit config.
- [ ] Add unit tests.
- [ ] Generate `.srt` files with the text along with its timestamp. 
- [ ] Add a percentage to the progress bar.

You can propose a new feature creating an [issue](https://github.com/HenestrosaConH/audiotext/issues/new/choose).
